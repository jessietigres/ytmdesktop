# My Discord Rich Presences isn't working!?!?!?!?

### The following settings need to be enabled:
#### YTM Desktop:
- Go to Settings -> Integrations -> Discord Rich Presences and Enable the option there. (Click setting to manage what is shown)

#### Discord:
- Go to Settings -> Activity Status and make sure that it is enabled

### Additional Information:
- Do not run Discord or YTM Desktop as Admin, as this messes around with Permissions of the RPC connection between the two, and Keybindings ETC. [This is not recommended as a whole for either applicaiton. but can be needed within Discord to allow Keybinds in games which run as Admin.]
- You do not add YTM Desktop as an Application inside of Discord. [This is manually adding a static game] as this will overwrite the Visual displayed game with whatever Discord has been given. [Normally Artist or App name]
- Try Restarting both Discord and YTM Desktop, the Connection for Discord typically needs to be opened first and then YTM Desktop second. 
- Running Multiple Clients [Not supported by Discord] will ALWAYS connect to the first Client opened.
- Discord Linux is basically unsupported for the last 2 years+ and likely has an issue regarding RPC Connections for that platform. [Reviewing the "official" Discord Linux server, it's even said to be very broken on there, and there's a few "hacks" around, but that's for you to do research on and not me.]
